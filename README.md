<h4>ðŸ‘‹Nice to meet you!</h4>
<p>
  Hey there! I'm Kevin, a passionate 29-year-old front-end developer with a deep love for coding.<br />
  I believe in the power of design-driven development. Every line of code I write is aimed at not just functionality, <br />
  but also aesthetic appeal and user-friendliness. I take pride in turning concepts into captivating, interactive web applications.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  Coding has been my companion since I can remember. <br />
  From my early days experimenting with simple scripts to the complex world of web development, <br />
  I've always been drawn to the allure of technology and problem-solving. <br />
  Coding is more than just a job to me; it's a lifelong fascination. <br />
  In the ever-evolving world of front-end development, I understand the importance of staying ahead. <br />
  I embrace new technologies and methodologies, attending conferences, taking online courses, and collaborating with fellow developers. <br />
  Learning is a never-ending journey, and I'm on board.
